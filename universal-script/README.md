# universal-script
This script is my sort of hub from where I do 90% of my work


It allows for easy system/vendor (re)mounting and resizing, as well
as producing common vendor images on diff files between vendors.


It's hardcoded to my username in some scripts, make sure to correct it
before running. 


In the future I want it to be able to produce fully flashable ZIPs.
